I started with absolutely zero lines of code. I had no idea of what is Blockchain, what excatly is bitcoin (cryptocurrency) what is that buzz "bitcoin mining" is actually? I was really curious to knw all of these. 

After searching lot of tutorials and youtube videos, I finally landed on this book  (https://www.packtpub.com/in/web-development/learn-blockchain-programming-javascript)[**Learn Blockchain Programming with JavaScript by Eric Traub**] He taught things very gradually and explaining each and every line of code, the theory behind it and testing out every single function or API we build while reading book.

I guess even if someone who doesn't have any JS experience would easily follow the book and really get the idea of what is Blockchain, decentralized systems, cryptocurrencies, and testing things you write.



### ‚õ≥Ô∏è What I Learnt

1. What is Blockchain & how to build it
2. How cryptocurrency works
3. What is proof of work & cryptocurrency mining
4. What is consensus algorithm & how to implement it
5. Creating API endpoints for :
    1. Preview Blockchain
    2. Create transactions
    3. Mine Blocks
    4. Register Network Nodes
    5. Check Blockchain Integrity with Consensus Algorithm
    6. Get Block Data by Hash
    7. Get transaction data by transactionId
    8. Get details from user address
    
6. **WHAT DOES IT MEAN BY DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM & How to build your own!** (this one blew my mind - If you have watched Silicon Valley Show, you are in for treat üòÖ)  7. Creating GUI Tool - Blockchain Block explorer consuming API endpoints
